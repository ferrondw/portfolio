# Introduction

2D2D is a game made for the [International Educational Game Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/international-educational-game-jam-2024), a game jam competition where we as developers needed to team up with artists from another country

We had 2 days to make a game from start to finish, there were no rankings or prizes as this jam was completely for fun!

# Mechanics

Every platformer needs... Well movement of course! Ours is REALLY basic because of the harsh time contraints, but overall it feels juicy by also mixing in coyote time and jump buffering

Besides the basic movement, the main part of what makes this game fun is the *dimension switching*!

This way we can make MUCH more interesting level design where you need to manage both your own movement and which dimension you are in

We came up with the idea to implement something that is *interactable* to make levels more dynamic

And that's why there are buttons in the game

But actually this mechanic is really funky when looking in the Unity Editor, because it is an *actual physical button*...

There is still a bug in the game that if you phase through a block to get underneath a button, it will fly up instead of press down.

This is because the buttons don't have gravity, they are basically floating/hovering until the player steps on them, when pressed down it hits a hidden collider and activates whatever it needs to

# Settings

While we crunched to get the game completed in time, I had the opportunity to create a settings menu, though it does not have a lot of options, it helped make the game a little bit better

# Mobile

There was the big idea to re-make the complete game with all it's mechanics for mobile, but the idea was quickly scrapped as we were all busy with our internships and other personal projects.

I did remake the movement with more advanced mechanics like dashing, wall jumping and tilt-and-stretch visuals, but that project is now abandoned
